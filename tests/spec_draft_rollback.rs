//! Regression: rejected-draft rollback on the GPU-resident draft-model path.
//!
//! `ModelDrafter::draft` rolls its session back to the accepted prefix before each
//! round (`rollback_resident_to_position`). That lowers `kv_cache.position`, so the
//! resident engine's own `filled` must move with it — otherwise the next resident
//! decode reads `filled() != position` as a new sequence and reseeds the GPU cache
//! from a CPU KV history a GPU-resident drafter never wrote (`keys` is grown only by
//! `ensure_position_capacity`), indexing an empty buffer:
//!
//!   thread 'main' panicked at src/inference/metal_resident.rs:
//!   range end index 64 out of range for slice of length 0
//!
//! On macOS that reset existed only under `#[cfg(feature = "cuda")]`, so every
//! `--drafter draft` run without `--cpu-draft` panicked at the first partially
//! rejected round. This test drives exactly that sequence: draft a round, then draft
//! again from a history that diverges inside the drafted tail.
//!
//! Skips cleanly when the env var is unset (CI carries no model files); run locally:
//!   CAMELID_DRAFT_ROLLBACK_GGUF=/path/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf \
//!     cargo test --release --test spec_draft_rollback -- --nocapture
