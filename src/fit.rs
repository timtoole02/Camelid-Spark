//! Model *fit* advisor — a capacity verdict for "can this machine run this model?".
//!
//! This is a **capacity axis only**. A [`FitVerdict::FitsResident`] means the
//! model's footprint fits the detected memory budget — it says **nothing** about
//! whether the model is *supported* (`COMPATIBILITY.md`) or *runnable-lane
//! anchored* (`crate::runnable`). Those are separate axes and must never be
//! conflated in copy or code.
//!
//! The math is a pure, GPU-free heuristic over byte counts, in the same spirit as
//! [`crate::cuda_vram::evaluate`] (which this module reuses for the VRAM branch).
//! It is **advisory**: the authoritative guards remain the mid-load
//! [`crate::cuda_vram::VramShortfall`] and the mid-generation
//! `BackendError::KvCacheBudgetExceeded` (`src/inference/kv_cache.rs`). This layer
//! only helps a user *choose* before they commit; it never gates a download and
//! never relaxes a runtime guard.
//!
//! On hosts where memory cannot be probed (e.g. macOS, where
//! [`crate::capability::HardwareProfile`] reports `host_ram_total_bytes == 0`) the
//! verdict degrades to [`FitVerdict::Unknown`] rather than guessing — an unknown
//! host must never read as "won't fit".
