# Backend asks — endpoint/contract needs discovered during the frontend overhaul

The UI never stubs fake data for these; each ask names the surface that stays
guarded until the contract grows.

## 1. Sampling-parameter capability rows (Phase 2, 2026-06-12)

**Surface waiting on it:** the chat "Generation controls" drawer renders every
sampling parameter (temperature, top_p, top_k, stop, seed) as a guarded
read-only row because `/api/capabilities` `api_features` advertises no sampling
rows at all. Chat keeps sending greedy `temperature: 0` — the lane the parity
evidence covers.

**Ask:** advertise one feature row per parameter the backend actually honors on
`/v1/chat/completions`, with the usual status vocabulary, e.g.:

```json
{
  "id": "sampling_temperature",
  "status": "supported_current_gate",
  "notes": "temperature in [0,2] honored for streaming + non-streaming chat completions; evidence row-scoped to the current gate"
}
```

The frontend already resolves rows by exact id (`sampling_<param>` or
`<param>`, no resemblance matching — `lib/samplingContract.js`) and will unlock
the matching control, persist last-used values per model id, and merge the
override into the request body only while the row stays supported. No frontend
change needed when the rows appear.

**Not asked:** any claim that sampled output has parity evidence. If sampled
lanes need their own evidence categories, that belongs in the compatibility
rows, not the feature row notes.

## 2. Evidence-bundle manifest references on compatibility rows (Phase 4, 2026-06-12)

**Surface waiting on it:** the Compatibility ledger's per-row evidence checklist cites
what the contract exposes today — the `*_pack_id` identifiers (e.g.
`tinyllama-context-512-smoke-v1`). The repo's qa/evidence-bundles manifests
(README/COMPATIBILITY.md reference them by path) are not addressable from
`/api/capabilities`, so chip popovers can name a pack id but cannot cite its manifest.

**Ask:** add an optional manifest reference per evidence lane, e.g.

```json
{
  "bounded_context_512_pack": "validated_bounded_pack",
  "bounded_context_512_pack_id": "tinyllama-context-512-smoke-v1",
  "bounded_context_512_pack_manifest": "qa/evidence-bundles/tinyllama-context-512-.../manifest.json"
}
```

Repo-relative paths only (no absolute filesystem paths — the frontend will render them
as citations, and I7 keeps absolute paths out of shareable surfaces). The ledger picks
up `*_pack_manifest` fields automatically once they appear.

## 3. System memory + KV-cache cost for the response-length control (Phase 9, 2026-06-12)

**Surface waiting on it:** Settings → Response length renders its memory ceiling
marker and projected-memory gauge ABSENT (with an explanatory line) because neither
input exists on the API. The frontend will not estimate RAM client-side or invent KV
math from assumed dtypes.

**Ask (exact fields, units = bytes):**
1. `GET /api/system/memory` → `{ "total_bytes": u64, "available_bytes": u64,
   "process_rss_bytes": u64 }` (or fold the same fields into `/v1/health`).
2. On `/api/models/current` (and ideally `/v1/models` meta):
   `"kv_bytes_per_token": u64` for the loaded runtime configuration — or, if
   preferred, `"kv_cache_dtype": "f16" | "f32" | ...` so the frontend can combine it
   with the GGUF block_count / head_count_kv / key_length / value_length already
   exposed. Also useful: `"kv_cached_tokens": u32` (current cache occupancy) so the
   projection can subtract already-resident tokens.

Once present, the control renders: projected = process_rss_bytes +
(value − kv_cached_tokens) × kv_bytes_per_token vs available_bytes, labeled
"estimated", with red above available RAM and amber above 85% — formula shown in the
readout's popover.

## 4. Runnable-lane HTTP serve/generate endpoint (Models tab Gate 4, 2026-06-17)

**Surface waiting on it:** Models tab → "Compatible" lane rows (smoke-admitted, runnable
f32 lane). These models have a runnable receipt proving deterministic execution, but the
UI offers NO in-app "Use for chat" for them — only the Supported lane gets a load button
(it loads into the parity chat backend via `POST /api/models/load`). The runnable lane is
a separate generic-f32 engine with only `POST /api/models/runnable-smoke` (one-shot smoke)
and the `camelid runnable-smoke` CLI. There is no interactive serve/generate route, so the
frontend cannot — and will not fake — a chat session against the runnable lane.

**Ask (one of):**
1. `POST /api/models/runnable-generate` → `{ filename, prompt, max_tokens, ... }` returning
   `{ tokens, text }` from the runnable engine (stateless or KV-cached), OR
2. let `POST /api/models/load` accept `{ lane: "runnable" }` so a runnable-only model can be
   loaded into a runnable serving context and reuse `/v1/completions` with an explicit
   `execution_lane: "runnable"` echoed on every response (so the chat UI can label it amber,
   never copper, and keep the parity-locked Send-gate off for it).

Until then the Compatible rows stay receipt-only with an explicit "CLI only — no HTTP serve
yet" note; membership and evidence remain fully derived, nothing is invented.
